# Localization

We aim to develop a system capable of obtaining semantic information about the interior space while autonomously navigating in seen and unseen locations. 

The system employs three parameters:
Outdoor Location  (GPS coordinates),
Indoor Location (WiFi signal intensities),
Proximity Objects  (objects in the surrounding and their relation).

With this knowledge, a mobile rover can effectively move around an indoor space and comprehend and adjust to its changing surroundings, even if the location is unseen.
